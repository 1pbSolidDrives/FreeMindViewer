# FreeMindViewer
Online-Viewer for MindMaps created with FreeMind

Project initiated and maintained by Jirka Dell'Oro-Friedl, Hochschule Furtwangen University
First version written by Konstantin RÃ¶hm as studen research project in summer 2014

##Current Version 0.2.0
a server running php needed in order to serve and store the mind maps

## TODOs
Remove php-skripts to make it run javascript only. Uploading maps is outside of the scope of this project and should be implemented, when it's extended to become an online editor.
